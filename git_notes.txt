// OPEN FILE: to open files via command line, use the command 'start'.
// ls -a will show all the files (including hidden files such as .git when first initialised) 
	in your working directory
// in order to start tracking the changes made to files via git, then we need to add the file 
	to a staging area.
// GIT STATUS: to see what is currently in the staging area, the command is 'git status'
// GIT ADD: in order to add it to the staging area (the file is currently in the working directory) 
	and start tracking changes, we use the command 'git add {filename}'
// COMMIT: to commit the file under version control, the command is 'git commit -m {message}'
// LOG: to see what commits you have made, use the 'git log' command - the hash uniquly identifies 
	the particular commit.
