// OPEN FILE: to open files via command line, use the command 'start'.

// ls -a will show all the files (including hidden files such as .git when first initialised) 
	in your working directory

// in order to start tracking the changes made to files via git, then we need to add the file 
	to a staging area.

// GIT STATUS: to see what is currently in the staging area, the command is 'git status'.
	this also shows what files have been modified without being commited yet.

// GIT ADD: in order to add it to the staging area (the file is currently in the working directory) 
	and start tracking changes, we use the command 'git add {filename}'
	'git add .' adds every file into the staging area from the folder.

// COMMIT: to commit the file under version control, the command is 'git commit -m {message}'
	This places the file into your local repository.

// LOG: to see what commits you have made, use the 'git log' command - the hash uniquly identifies 
	the particular commit.

// GIT DIFF: the command 'git diff {filename}' shows what unsaved changes have been made to the file

// GIT CHECKOUT: this command will revert back to the last saved version 'git checkout {filename}'
